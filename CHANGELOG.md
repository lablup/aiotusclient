### Features
* Add `-b`, `--base-dir` option to the `vfolder upload` command and allow use of colon as mount path-mapping separator like docker CLI ([#106](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-client-py/issues/106))
* Add support for announcements, including automatic display of the message when executing a CLI command if available and a new commandset "announcement" to manage the announcement message for superadmins and to dismiss the last shown message for normal users ([#107](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-client-py/issues/107))
* Add starts_at option for creating session. ([#109](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-client-py/issues/109))

* The phase 1 for API v5 schema updates ([#97](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-client-py/issues/97))
  - Drop support for Python 3.6
  - Apply kernel/session naming changes
* The phase 2 for API v5 schema updates ([#103](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-client-py/issues/103))
  - `Agent.list_with_limit()` is replaced with `Agent.paginated_list()`.

* The phase 1 for API v5 schema updates ([#97](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-client-py/issues/97))
  - `admin rescan-images` now have a working progress bar!
* File rename command for a file/directory inside a virtual folder. ([#99](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-client-py/issues/99))
* Improve console-server support with proxy-mode API sessions ([#100](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-client-py/issues/100))
* Add `backend.ai server-logs` command-set to list server-stored error logs ([#101](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-client-py/issues/101))
* Improve and refactor pagination to avoid excessive server queries and apply to more CLI commands ([#102](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-client-py/issues/102))
* The phase 2 for API v5 schema updates ([#103](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-client-py/issues/103))
  - Session queries now work with the API v5 GraphQL schema and recognizes multi-container sessions
  - Improve pagination for `admin agents`, `admin sessions`, `admin users`, and `admin keypairs` commands
  - Add support for async generator API function methods, wrapped as synchronouse plain generators in synchronouse API sessions
  - Add new filtering options to `admin agents` (scaling groups) and `admin users` (user groups)

### Fixes
* Remove a bogus "bad file descriptor" error when commands exiting via exceptions ([#103](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-client-py/issues/103))

### Miscellaneous
* The phase 1 for API v5 schema updates ([#97](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-client-py/issues/97))
  - API function classes are now type-checked and interoperable with Python IDEs such as PyCharm, since references to the current active session is rewritten to use `contextvars`.


20.03.0a1 (2020-04-07)
----------------------

### Breaking Changes
* Breaking Changes without explicit PR/issue numbers
  Now the client SDK runs on Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8 and dropped support for Python 3.5.
* All functional API classes are moved into the `ai.backend.client.func` sub-package.
  [(#82)](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-client-py/issues/82)
  - `Kernel` is changed to `Session`.
  - The session ID field name in the response of `Session` objects
    is now `session_id` instead of `kernel_id`.
  - Except above, this would not introduce big changes in the SDK user
    codes since they use `AsyncSession` and `Session` in the
    `ai.backend.client.session` module.

### Features
* Features without explicit PR/issue numbers
  - Add SDK API (`SessionTemplate`) and CLI command set (`backend.ai sesstpl`)
* Support for unmanaged vfolders and token-based download API
  [(#77)](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-client-py/issues/77)
* `backend.ai config` command now displays the server/client component and API versions with negotiated API version if available.
  [(#79)](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-client-py/issues/79)
* Add `--format` and `--plain` options to `backend.ai ps` command to customize the output table format
  [(#80)](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-client-py/issues/80)
* Perform automatic API version negotiation when entering session contexts while keeping the functional API same
  [(#82)](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-client-py/issues/82)
* Support dotfiles management API and CLI
  [(#85)](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-client-py/issues/85)

### Fixes
* Refine details of the `app` command such as error handling
  [(#90)](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-client-py/issues/90)
* Improve exception handling in ``backend.ai app`` command and update backend.ai-cli package
  [(#94)](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-client-py/issues/94)
