19.09.8 (2020-04-23)
--------------------

* NEW(backported): Add `backend.ai vfolder rename-file` command (#99)

19.09.7 (2020-03-31)
--------------------

* FIX: Not-implemented-error in `backend.ai app` command on Windows, due
  to manually set event loop UNIX signal handlers. (#93)
* FIX: Now *all* CLI commands set exit codes correctly for interrupts
  (Ctrl+C on Windows or SIGINT on POSIX systems) so that batch/shell
  scripts that use `backend.ai` commands get interrupted properly.
  (#93)

19.09.6 (2020-03-16)
--------------------

* NEW: Add `-f` / `--forced` option to `backend.ai terminate` command
  and add an optional `forced` keyword-argument to SDK API (`Kernel.destroy()`). (#89)
* IMPROVE: Prettify the console output for admin CLI commands. (#91)

19.09.5 (2020-03-08)
--------------------

* NEW: Add `backend.ai restart` command and improve error handling in
  the `backend.ai terminate` command.

19.09.4 (2020-02-10)
--------------------

* NEW: SDK API (`EtcdConfig`) and CLI command (`backend.ai admin etcd`)
  to allow querying and updating etcd configurations by admins.

19.09.3 (2019-12-03)
--------------------

* NEW: SDK API (`Auth.update_password()`) and CLI command (`backend.ai update-password`)
  to allow changing the password by the users themselves.
* NEW: SDK API (`VFolder.delete_by_id()`) so that superadmins can delete
  a vfolder owned by arbitrary user/group.

19.09.2 (2019-11-04)
--------------------

* NEW: API for disassociating scaling groups from a user group
* FIX: Regression in "admin keypairs" command due to code/server changes

19.09.1 (2019-10-15)
--------------------

* OPTIMIZE: vfolder downloads and application proxies are faster to transfer large files due to increased
  network buffer sizes.
* FIX: The kernel/vfolder download APIs now uses the default event loop executor for file write
  operations which reduces latency jitters in user async applications that embeds this SDK.
* FIX: Remove a wrong default for the `--list-all` option of the `backend.ai vfolder list` command.
* DOCS: Add manuals for SSH/SFTP usage.

19.09.0 (2019-10-07)
--------------------

* NEW: Add read-timeout configuration (`BACKEND_READ_TIMEOUT`) to limit the time taken for waiting
  server responses.  Its default is set to infinity for now because currently some core APIs require
  indefinite waiting to get responses.
